#Git and Github Tutorial

This tutorial gives basic instructions for creating a repository on Github then initialising and pushing some code to that repository. It will also cover changing that code locally and pushing those changes to Github.

###Create a github account

Use a name that means something to your colleagues.  Preferably a nice avatar too.

###Authenticate your computer with your github account.

Follow the instruction at this page.  Make sure that you use the same e-mail that you used to create the github account.

###Create a github repository

- Click the 'new repository' button on your github homepage.
- Create a public repo with no readme or gitignore file.
- Once the repository is created, follow the instructions on github to "â€¦or create a new repository on the command line"
- View your code in github

###Creating a new branch and changing the code

We are going to change the code, but do this on a branch of the code.  
You can create a branch on github itself by going to the main page for a repo
and clicking the branch drop down.
